The Retinal Scan Analyser takes a Retinal scan image, rescales it and predicts the disease.
(for instance this retinal scan is of a person suffering from glaucoma)

Open this code in JupyterNotebook.

"ML_OCT.ipynb" is the code used to train the model.
"OCT_model.hb" and "OCT_model.keras" are the trained model.
"Retinal_Scan_Analyser.ipynb" is the code that implements the already trained model.
